# Sigrok esp 32 

A SUMP compatible Logical Analyser for the esp32, for use with i.e sigrok
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigrok

Pins defined for logical input.

```
            12,
            13,
            14,
            15,
```

The key to using the ESP32 with sigrok was using the WROVER-kit. :-P
It was not the code in this repository... Accidental success. 
I knew there was something strange when the code was working on the first try. It is thanks to the JTAG, chips on the WROVER-KIT board that data acquisition was working so well.

When starting pulseview with logging,  -l 5 it seems that the FTDI-LA drivers were used.

https://sigrok.org/gitweb/?p=libsigrok.git;a=tree;f=src/hardware/ftdi-la
For me it solves the problem and allows sampling without a second ESP32 up to 10Mhz.

I found that terminal program cutecom allowed sending single HEX bytes, this is useful for debugging the implementation of the SUMP protocol.


In sigrok the following WROVER-KIT pins are mapped like this.
```
PIN13 = ADBUS0
PIN12 = ADBUS1
PIN15 = ADBUS2
PIN14 = ADBUS3
```


THE Jtag interface uses the following pins.
```
1 	CHIP_PU 	TRST_N
2 	MTDO / GPIO15 	TDO
3 	MTDI / GPIO12 	TDI
4 	MTCK / GPIO13 	TCK
5 	MTMS / GPIO14 	TMS
```


Also the following red/green blue led is available on the WROVER kit.
```
  RED    gpio_set_direction(GPIO_NUM_0, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT);
  GREEN  gpio_set_direction(GPIO_NUM_2, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT);
  BLUE   gpio_set_direction(GPIO_NUM_4, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT);
	gpio_set_level(GPIO_NUM_0, 0);
```


After making sure you use the correct Component config â†’ 
ESP32-specific -> Main XTAL frequency
A good idea, might be to set these values.
```
  Bootloader log verbosity (No output)  --->    
  Compiler options ->  Optimization Level (Release (-Os)) 
```


To get some test data, on GPIO_NUM_21 a 30/15 ms pulse is generated with the remote device.
```
app_main() {
    ...
    send_remote_pulses();
    rmt_write_items(config.channel, items, 1, 0);
}
```
When starting the sigrok gui, pulseview, the device was identified and this is how the timing analysis looks like.

Other than the SUMP protocol we could try to emulate this RIGOL osciloscope,
