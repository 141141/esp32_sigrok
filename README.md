# Sigrok esp 32 

A SUMP compatible Logical Analyser for the esp32, for use with i.e sigrok
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigrok

Pins defined for logical input.

```
            12,
            13,
            14,
            15,
```

The key to using the ESP32 with sigrok was using the WROVER-kit. :-P
It was not the code in this repository... Accidental success. 
I knew there was something strange when the code was working on the first try. It is thanks to the JTAG, chips on the WROVER-KIT board that data acquisition was working so well.

In this code the sump protocol is implemented over USB and tcp/ip. 

When starting pulseview with logging,  -l 5 it seems that the FTDI-LA drivers were used.

https://sigrok.org/gitweb/?p=libsigrok.git;a=tree;f=src/hardware/ftdi-la
For me it solves the problem and allows sampling without a second ESP32 up to 10Mhz.

I found that terminal program cutecom allowed sending single HEX bytes, this is useful for debugging the implementation of the SUMP protocol.


In sigrok the following WROVER-KIT pins are mapped like this.
```
PIN13 = ADBUS0
PIN12 = ADBUS1
PIN15 = ADBUS2
PIN14 = ADBUS3
```


THE Jtag interface uses the following pins.
```
1 	CHIP_PU 	TRST_N
2 	MTDO / GPIO15 	TDO
3 	MTDI / GPIO12 	TDI
4 	MTCK / GPIO13 	TCK
5 	MTMS / GPIO14 	TMS
```


Also the following red/green blue led is available on the WROVER kit.
```
  RED    gpio_set_direction(GPIO_NUM_0, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT);
  GREEN  gpio_set_direction(GPIO_NUM_2, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT);
  BLUE   gpio_set_direction(GPIO_NUM_4, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT);
	gpio_set_level(GPIO_NUM_0, 0);
```


After making sure you use the correct Component config â†’ 
ESP32-specific -> Main XTAL frequency
A good idea, might be to set these values.
```
  Bootloader log verbosity (No output)  --->    
  Compiler options ->  Optimization Level (Release (-Os)) 
```


To get some test data, on GPIO_NUM_21 a 30/15 ms pulse is generated with the remote device.
```
app_main() {
    ...
    send_remote_pulses();
    rmt_write_items(config.channel, items, 1, 0);
}
```
When starting the sigrok gui, pulseview, the device was identified and this is how the timing analysis looks like.

# Project status
Currently not working well.

It has howerer , SCPI over the network ,
sigrok-cli -d rigol-ds:conn=tcp-raw/127.0.0.1/5555  -l 5 --scan
And some sump over network or USB, however libsigrok only supports SUMP over USB.
Instead sump over TCP/IP was used for debugging.
nc 192.168.1.130 5566

For data aquisition High resolution timer is used.
http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/system/esp_timer.html

Trying to  add rigol emulation and emulate sending of analouge and digital waveforms

In directory linux, you can build a test client, it listens to port 5555
./test

To try connect 
 sigrok-cli -d rigol-ds:conn=tcp-raw/127.0.0.1/5555  -l 5 --scan
This will send *IDN? to the instrument

You can also try this 
./olas-cli -d rigol-ds:conn=tcp-raw/192.168.1.130/5555  -l 5  --show

Unfortunatley this software currently does not work well enough.

```
To build a debuggable version of sigrok-cli use the CMakeLists.txt file
 mkdir sigrok;cd sigrok;
 git clone git://sigrok.org/libsigrokcxx.git
 // Not this?? git clone git://sigrok.org/libsigrok.git
 git clone git://sigrok.org/sigrok-cli
 cp CMakeLists.txt .
 mkdir build;cd build; cmake ..
 ./olas-cli -d rigol-ds:conn=tcp-raw/192.168.1.127/5555  -l 5  --show
```

To test reading data with sump.
./olas-cli -d ols:conn=/dev/ttyUSB1 -l 5  -c samplerate=1Mhz --samples 100

```
