#Sigrok esp 32 

A SUMP compatible Logical Analyser for the esp32, for use with i.e sigrok
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigrok

Pins defined for logical input.

```
            12,
            13,
            14,
            15,
            16,
```

After making sure you use the correct Component config â†’ ESP32-specific -> Main XTAL frequency
A good idea, might be to set these.
```
  Bootloader log verbosity (No output)  --->    
  Compiler options ->  Optimization Level (Release (-Os)) 
```


To get some test data, on GPIO_NUM_21 a 30/15 ms pulse is generated with the remote device.
```
app_main() {
    ...
    send_remote_pulses();
    rmt_write_items(config.channel, items, 1, 0);
}
```
When starting the sigrok gui, pulseview, the device was identified and this is how the timing analysis looks like.
